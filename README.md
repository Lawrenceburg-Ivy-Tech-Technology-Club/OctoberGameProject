# Cybersecurity Awareness Game
A command-line text game aims to raise awareness for good cybersecurity practices in the workplace by putting the player in the shoes of a cybersecurity consultant reviewing a company's cybersecurity practices.
## About
This project is a collaborative effort by Ivy Tech Lawrenceburg's Technology Club to provide attendees of the October 2024 Cyber Hygiene Seminar with an intuitive way of learning good cybersecurity practices.

In this game, the player takes on the role of a cybersecurity consultant hired by a company to identify ways to improve their cybersecurity practices.

The player is presented with different scenarios related to cybersecurity and must select the correct response to the scenario. The player is scored based on how they choose to respond to each scenario.

At the conclusion of the game, the final score is tallied and the player is rated on how well they performed. The player is given a debrief on what they did well and what they need to improve on.
